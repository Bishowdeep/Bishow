Hey there! I'm Bishow Deep a tech enthusiast with a passion for all things related to computers and technology. My journey into the computer world started back in grade 6, and although it was challenging at first, I persevered and fell in love with it.

Apart from my techy side, I'm also a photography enthusiast. I have a profound love for travel, and my camera is my trusty companion on my adventures. My favorite subjects to capture are portraits, as they tell stories and capture the essence of people and places.

Now, let's talk about my other love - coffee. I'm an unabashed coffee addict. There's nothing quite like starting my weekends with a steaming cup of coffee, some good music in the background, and a stack of assignments to tackle. I find solace in these quiet moments.
